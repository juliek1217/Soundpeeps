# Soundpeeps Version 1.0.0
## Soundpeeps is a social networking app. Use Soundpeeps to find someone to go to upcoming concert or music festival together.
## Android app project

The features and backend will later be extended to fit the Apple iPhone, and a web app.
There are only four features so far. I will add more features after my final exams ;)
